# .env is the default environment, so you must ensure .env file is filled first, then dev env
# variables are filled as well in .env.dev.
# Those variables are loaded by src/environment/env.tsx
# To add a new environment, add for example a .env.staging and add the corresponding scripts in
# package.json, e.g. `"build:staging": "env-cmd .env.staging npm run build",`.
